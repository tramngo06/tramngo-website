            <h3>My name is Tram Ngo, I currently live in Galesburg, Illinois. And here is my journey of being a tech girly.</h3>
            <p>
                I started my journey on coding when I met my mom’s friend when I was in high school in Viet Nam. She’s a brilliant full-stack developer. I had a chance to visit your work office and she showed me everything she does in coding, which I found really cool. I love the feeling of learning how to code and create every brilliant product by just typing on the computer. I started to learn Python when I was a senior in high school, and tried to solve some coding problems. They were hard, of course, but I love the feeling after solving them. <br>
           
            </p>
            <p id="aboutmore" style="display: none;">
                Beside coding, I also love math and statistics. I realized I’m a type of person who is easy to work with numbers and interpret them, even though they're the subject people think are boring and dry. One day, I just made a random decision and told my parents that I want to apply to a gifted school. At first, they didn’t think it wasn’t a good idea because I barely prepared anything before applying. Seeing a lot of students who already had their own path to apply for that school makes me jealous but also motivated. I told myself “What if I just tried as hard as I can, if it doesn’t work out then it would be an experience for me to get better”. And I got in, I got into the gifted math program, but the score is almost the last list among other students. Before college, I already knew that I would be studying Data Science or anything related to Computer Science. I wasn’t sure what I was going to do with my future at that time because I didn’t know where to start. That’s why people say college is one of the biggest steps in life. I learned so many new things in coding like different programming languages (Java, C#, SQL,...), machine learning, and data analysis. I started with a small Machine Learning project in Python, it’s called “Twitter Text Sentiment”, which is described clearly under the Project section. Professor at school also helped me with brainstorming and showed me a lot of helpful sources. Besides, I also want to try more Front-end developers by making this personal portfolio using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I know I’m not a good planner, I’m just a person who follows her own interests and wants to learn a lot about it. The more I learn, the more passion I get in this field. And I am ready to explore more. I’m not scared of failure, I believe failure is what life means to make a person become a better version of themselves. And that’s why I’m here, in another whole country across from home, meeting new people, trying new things, and continuing my endless journey.
